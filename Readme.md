 Creating and Running Python files

 Shell scripting vs Python.
 1. Python is not OS Dependent and run on any Operating System.
 2. Python can work as a backend language.
 3. Rich Modules Inventory for python.
 4. When compared to shell very less effort is needed.
    Eg: I want to create a dummy data for 10 users with name, email, ssn, etc etc

Declare variables in Python and access them using Print?
a = 10
b = "20"
type(a)
type(b)
new course = '''
    WELCOME
    TO
    DEVOPS
    TRAINING 
    IN
    TELUGU'''
